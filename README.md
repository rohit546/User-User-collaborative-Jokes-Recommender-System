# User-User-collaborative-Jokes-Recommender-System

Dataset purpose:
This link contains different versions of the Jester dataset, which contains user ratings about jokes.
Download the Dataset 3 variant (2.3 million ratings), read the data description carefully to
understand the file structure.

Objectives:
• Your task is to design a user-user collaborative Jokes Recommender System using the
concepts studied in the course only.
• Design an architecture diagram to explain your recommender system and any other necessary
component (i.e., data preprocessing).
• Test your model’s performance using train-test (80/20) splits, predict jokes ratings based on K
most similar users. The optimal value of K should be decided by you. Use Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) as an evaluation metric.
• Implement a base random recommender system which will predict rating using some K random
users.
• Show performance comparisons between the base and your model.

General guidelines:
• There shall be no collaboration/discussion across different teams of both sections.
• You are restricted to only use the concepts studied in the class.
• For any confusion, consult the course instructor in a timely manner (avoid 11th hour
discussions).

• The course recommender should be implemented in Python.
Submission requirements:
1. Submit your Python notebook. For evaluation purposes, ensure that the code shows the
following.
a. Top 2K users with the similarity measure.
b. Test data instances with original and predicted values.
