# User-User-collaborative-Jokes-Recommender-System
Objectives:
• Your task is to design a user-user collaborative Jokes Recommender System using the
concepts studied in the course only.
• Design an architecture diagram to explain your recommender system and any other necessary
component (i.e., data preprocessing).
• Test your model’s performance using train-test (80/20) splits, predict jokes ratings based on K
most similar users. The optimal value of K should be decided by you. Use Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) as an evaluation metric.
• Implement a base random recommender system which will predict rating using some K random
users.
• Show performance comparisons between the base and your model.
